![](./icons/logo_bot.png =150x)
This is just another ML Discord-bot. Coded in nodejs using keras and tensorflow modules.
Its purpose is to manage a whole discord chat, analyzing messages, trying to find and remove offensive/hate speech from the channel.

This bot is meant to be used for experimenting stuffs. Streambytes is using this project to learn JS/nodejs and a bit of Machine Learning.
The bot is not optimized and totally not secured yet, feel free to use it on your own risk.
